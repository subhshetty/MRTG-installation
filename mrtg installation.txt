Specifically apache and snmpd needs to be installed. mrtg uses snmp to get information and apache2 to display it on web server
sudo apt-get install apache2
and
sudo apt-get install snmpd
and
sudo apt-get install snmp

Now you need to edit the /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf file
sudo vi /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

uncomment the following lines
#agentAddress udp:161,udp6:[::1]:161
to
agentAddress udp:161,udp6:[::1]:161
and
#rocommunity public localhost
to
rocommunity public localhost
if it still not works, go on to the snmpd changes file in my github
Save and exit the file

You need to restart the snmpd service using the following command
sudo systemctl snmpd restart

Installation
To install MRTG, simply run:
sudo apt-get install mrtg

Configuration
MRTG
Now that mrtg is installed, we must create a home where web pages related to the program can reside.
sudo mkdir /var/www/html/mrtg

Now you need to edit the /etc/mrt.cfg file
vi sudo /etc/mrt.cfg
change the working directory from
WorkDir: /var/www/mrtg
to
WorkDir: /var/www/html/mrtg
Save and exit the file

Backup the original /etc/mrt.cfg file:
sudo cp /etc/mrtg.cfg /etc/mrtg.cfg.ORIGINAL

Create a configuration file for MRTG:
cfgmaker <snmp_community_string>@<ip_address_of_device_to_be_monitored> > /etc/mrtg.cfg

Create and index file for the webserver :
indexmaker /etc/mrtg.cfg > /var/www/mrtg/index.html

Reboot your server and wait about 5 minutes before browsing to:
http://<server_ip>/mrtg
